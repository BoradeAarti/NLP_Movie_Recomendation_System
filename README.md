# NLP_Movie_Recomendation_System

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences. The system processes movie descriptions, user reviews, or metadata to generate recommendations using similarity measures such as TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

## 🔍 How It Works
1. Preprocess movie descriptions (Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stop-word removal)
2. Convert text into **TF-IDF vectors**
3. Compute **Cosine Similarity** between movies
4. Recommend top N similar movies based on input
